I recently decided to start a new career as a Software Developer. Programming is not completely new to me. Many years ago, 
I studied Computer Science at school & college, but back then I was programming BASIC and COBOL. Old school! I worked in many 
different roles in manufacturing & engineering industries. Parts of my job already involved bits and pieces of code, chiefly 
writing rules for parametric models using Autodesk’s proprietary ‘iLogic’ language. 

I’m very much looking forward to learning new things and working with people who are infinitely more experienced than myself!
