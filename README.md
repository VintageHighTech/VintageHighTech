- 👋 Hi, I’m @VintageHighTech, aka Chris Stephenson
- 👀 I’m interested in all aspects of software development. There's so much to learn!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, but also Spring, ReactJS, PostgreSQL & others
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Java projects where I can make a contribution and learn lots in the process.

After studying in my spare time for over a year, I recently decided to focus my energies on starting a new career as a software developer. Programming is not entirely new to me. I previously studied computer science at school & college, but back then I was programming BASIC and COBOL. Parts of my job already involved bits and pieces of code, chiefly writing rules for parametric models using Autodesk’s proprietary ‘iLogic’ language. 

I am looking forward to learning new things and working with people who are infinitely more experienced than myself!
